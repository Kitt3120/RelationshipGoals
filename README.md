# RelationshipGoals
 Little program I made for my girlfriend originally for Valentines Day, but as I couldn't finish it in time, I made it for her next birthday after ‚ù§
 
 ## Idea
 The program is based on the simple idea of having achievements (Goals) on a point-based system (Current points and points to unlock).
 Achievements can belong in an order to one or multiple GoalTrees.
 
 You have to unlock one Goal to see the title and description of the next one.
 
 ## Implement for yourself
 
 The program allows you to connect to your own database.
 
 The database schema should be implemented as shown in the SQL Diagram.
 
 The database user must have select, insert, update and delete privileges.
 
 An example for implementation can be found in SQLSetupExample.sql
